# Changelog

All notable changes to the AstroConnectSDK for iOS will be documented in this file.

---

## [1.0.12]

### Added

- **Pre-load terminal callback**: new `AstroConnect.preload(configuration:onPreloadEnded:)` overload that reports `.loaded`, `.deferred`, or `.failed(error)`.
- `AstroConnect.preload` now has a load timeout — the callback fires with `.failed` instead of hanging if the page never reaches a terminal state.
- **Home Banners documentation**: documented how to render `home-page` and `home-header` promotional banners via `flowParams.banners`. See [Home Banners](README.md#home-banners) in the README.
- **Topup flow parameters documentation**: documented `amount`, `currency`, and `suggestedAmounts` for the topup flow. See [Topup Flow Parameters](README.md#topup-flow-parameters) in the README.

### Fixed

- Fixed an unexpected biometric prompt that could appear before the SDK was visible when calling `AstroConnect.preload`. The prompt is now deferred until `AstroConnectView` is presented.

### Deprecated

- `AstroConnect.preload(configuration:onSuccess:onError:)` — use the new `onPreloadEnded` overload. The old callbacks still work. See the [Migration Guide](migrations/v1.0.11-to-v1.0.12.md).

---

## [1.0.11]

### Added

- **Pre-warming**: new `AstroConnect.preWarm` to initialize the SDK in the background early in the app lifecycle, reducing first-open latency. Optional `appIssuer` parameter prepares the co-branded header logo in advance.
- **Pre-loading**: new `AstroConnect.preload` to load the SDK with a specific configuration before presenting it, so `AstroConnectView` opens with no loading screen.
- **Clear**: new `AstroConnect.clear` to reset SDK data (cookies, local storage, caches) for a given environment. Also discards any active pre-load.

---

## [1.0.10]

### Added

- Added co-branded issuer logo in the SDK header. Controlled via `showHeaderLogo` in `AstroConfiguration`.

---

## [1.0.9]

### Added

- Added `biometricGracePeriod` parameter to control how long biometric re-prompting is suppressed after a successful authentication.
- Added biometric hardware availability check before registration.

---

## [1.0.8]

> **Breaking change:** `clientId` and `partnerUserId` are now required parameters in `AstroConfiguration`. See the [Migration Guide](migrations/v1.0.7-to-v1.0.10.md) for details.

### Added

- Added phone sign-in support.
